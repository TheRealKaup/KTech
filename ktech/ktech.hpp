// Avoids errors caused by files building order by not including the following inclusions in the other header files.
// For example `audio.hpp` might be processed first by the compiler, which will include `engine.hpp` via here, thus causing
// an incomplete type error, as it contains an `Audio` member, meanwhile, the `Audio` class hasn't been defined yet.
