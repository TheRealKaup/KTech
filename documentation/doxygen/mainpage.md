# API Reference

The Doxygen documentation includes **only** and **exclusively** the API reference.

There is more documentation to KTech, and all of it is listed in [the Git repository's `readme.md` file](https://github.com/TheRealKaup/KTech/blob/master/readme.md#documentation); the Doxygen reference is part of it.

Doxygen is not particularly good at mirroring markdown files by default, so I decided not to include here those which are part of the documentation. Programs such as VSCode and Ghostwriter do a much better job. The tutorial, which is in C++ source form, can't be conveyed properly in Doxygen anyway. So, if the entire documentation isn't put in one central location, the next best thing is separating it as needed, avoiding duplicates, and ensuring that finding all of its part is convenient.
